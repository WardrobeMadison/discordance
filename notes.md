# Notes with Jenna

## TODO

- [-] Add genotype and cell type to discordance h5 file :: Jenna needs' to send csv (symphony h5 file, cell label, genotype, cell type)
- [X] Get cell type from symphony h5 file
- [ ] Add Rstarr attribute (symphony h5 file name, cell label, lightmean, RStarr value)
- [ ] Add start p values from Jenna
- [X] Fix light amplitude parsing

General:
- [ ] Note sample size
- [ ] P value for genotype splits
- [ ] Add way to label spike names

LedPulse Analysis
- [ ] Average psth by cell, average psth by type per light amplitude and light mean. show genotype one
- [ ] Average bar graph above for peak amplitude and ttp, SEM and datapoints ignore cell split. Average of cells for datapoints only for LedPulse
- [-] Raster by cell, per light mean, light amplitude

LedPulseFamily Analysis
- [ ] Sensitivty curve :: RStarr / rod / sec, PeakAmplitude. SEM, p values, data points
- [ ] Sensitivty curve :: RStarr / rod / sec, TTP. SEM p values data point
- [ ] Average psth by cell, average psth by type per light amplitude and light mean: one graph for each light mean

LED = UV
- [ ] Contrast Response function :: percent contrast, peak amplitude (from psth). Inverst when percent contrast > 0. by light mean. how genotype one, SEM, p values, data points
- [ ] Average psth by cell, average psth by type per contrast and light mean.
