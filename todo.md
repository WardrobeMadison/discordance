# TODO 

## GUI
- [ ] COMPARE SPIKE DETECTION CODE
- [-] Replace light amplitude and light mean
- [X] Start X values at 0 where stimtime is
- [X] Automatic resizing of scroll window with subplots
- [X] Associate raster epoch plots with number of epoch for easier filtering
- [X] Change cell label to include experiment name
- [X] Display name of filter file being used
- [X] Test updating of celltyes and genotypes within GUI

## ANALYSIS
- [ ] Spike Analysis
    - [-] LED Pulse
        - [ ] Contrast response curve (UV LED only)
    - [ ] LED Pulse Family
        - [ ] Hill fit (Green LED)
- [ ] Whole Cell Analysis
    - [ ] Replace peak amplitude with min peak amp
    - [ ] Width at half max in addition to peak amp and ttp
    - [ ] Replace psth's with mean traces
    - [ ] Led Pulse 
        - [ ] Contrast response curve (UV LED only)
    - [ ] LED Pulse Family
        - [ ] Hill fit (Green LED)
        - [ ] Webere fit (peak amp gain)
- [ ] Linear model analysis


## DAY 2
- [-] Automatic plot update on uncheck Maybe add an uncheck button?
- [ ] Create logging for each session
- [ ] Check on 6_ file that doesn't have light mean, and other files with bad headers
- [ ] Information theory analysis
