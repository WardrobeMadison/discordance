# TODO 

## Jenna's Suggestions

- [?] PRIORITY 2 axes are overalled on some plots
- [?] Spikes>GreenLED>PulseFamily not all lightamplitudes are showing up in tree
- [X] PRIORITY Hill fit and CRF should be at the CellType level so that I can compare between genotype. There should be only 1 graph with 2 lines for each genotype
- [X] PRIORITY X axis for time in graphs needs to be broken up by 0.5 s increments
- [X] PRIORITY I like how the peak on the PSTH (or excitation/inhibition trace)  is denoted by the dotted line, but I also want the value of the peak to be shown. It would also be nice to see the value of the TTP (ask me for clarification)
- [X] PRIORITY everything needs to be averaged according to RStarr instead of SymphonyUnits
- [X] PRIORITY sample size needs to come up for graphs at the genotype
- [ ] PRIORITY sample size appears inconsistent between swarm plots and PSTHs (or excitation/inhibition trace)  at the CellType node
- [X] need to be able to uncheck at higher levels of the tree than epoch
- [?] Weber needs to be implemented!

- [ ] LN model needs to be implemented
- [ ] Epoch: print background amp value just for inhibition. Make inhibition analysis split on background amp 1 value
- [ ] Create logging for each session
- [ ] Information theory analysis
